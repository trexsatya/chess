### Chess Game
Functionalities:

1. Show the chessboard on terminal
2. Accept commands (highlight, move) & update the board accordingly
3. Perform validations before updating the board

## Haskell Guide

1. Haskell seems weird because it is based on completely different approach to computation. It basically tries to eliminate *state* (memory) from the programs.
   
   It tries to encode datastructures using functions. So, you can think that there are only three things in Haskell program. *Functions, Expressions, and Types*. Expressions and Types are basically used for declaring and implementing functions. So, in short it's all about functions alone.

2. Operator `$` is weird, Haskell Lint discourages its usage. https://typeclasses.com/featured/dollar
   In fact, coming from other popular languages, most of the syntax of Haskell will seem weird.
   
3. Prelude is the default package, you can look up the definitions in this package here: https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html
   This might be good for learning, see how the magic works.
