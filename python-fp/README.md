### Chess Game
Functionalities:

1. Show the chessboard on terminal
2. Accept commands (highlight, move) & update the board accordingly
3. Perform validations before updating the board

### Python Synopsis:

Python is a dynamically-typed language meaning that you don't have to declare type of the variables, functions, function parameters etc.<br>
This gives a lot of flexibility, but it also causes a lot of problems, it is easy to miss things and create bugs.<br>
That's why later on, Python introduced type-hinting feature, which allows IDEs etc to figure out some of the problems caused by dynamic-typing, it doesn't solve it though.

- Python has OOP features, as well as FP features
- Best language features of Python can be listed as:-
    1. List Comprehensions
    2. Tuples as immutable list
    3. Functions treated as first-class citizen (meaning you can store them in value, pass them around, return)
    4. You can capture parameters (both positional and key-value) dynamically. This (combined with things like decorators) gives power! 
    5. Operator overloading

### Python for Functional Programming:
You can implement Monads etc. `Maybe` monad in this implementation turned out to be just like `Optional` in Java language.
There's limited support for immutable data-structures.

Overall, Python is not bad for FP.
